#2017 Purdue Ironhack Tutorials    
   

Welcome to BlackIronhack! This pages aims to introduce you to various technologies that will be required as part of this programming challenge. There are three tutorial sessions. 
 
## Session 1

### 1. HTML   

HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language which is used to describe web pages.
 

### 2. CSS    

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.
  
Writing CSS code with hand is tedious, so generally CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are used.

### 3. Github

You'll be required to use Github.com for submitting your code to our system. <a href="session1/Github/Github-Tutorial.md" target="_blank">Here</a> is our tutorial on getting setup with Github.com for this hack. 

HTML, CSS and Github are introduced in session 1. For a quick start, you can refer to our tutorial. [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ROow9rDdBPrJkhUaoTVEoPvAm8mr1j7Xm4oaQH2u-d4) is the slide for training session 1 and sample code is also available [there](session1/html&css).

After reading and learning, [quizzes](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe298sR9yd9-aS-FDcmdcMh-K-qeEZS_GjDlbwyU2OSkeA_Pw/viewform?c=0&w=1) for HTML and CSS must be very helpful for you!

## Session 2

### 1. Javascript

Javascript is an object-oriented programming language to create interactive effects within web browsers.
 

### 2. jQuery

jQuery is the most widely used Javascript library, using jQuery would greatly speed up your Javascript programming.


Session 2 is about Javascript and jQuery. [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OYDpDXJI_I0kP3_MwuqNwsVqt2wb_JwlGoz0Eo7id30) is the slide for training session 2 and [here](session2) is the sample code.

[Quizzes](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzCbNSMh6tKwHfOuXbGob1dSPczeL_rLam0LyBokpnR9bITw/viewform?c=0&w=1) for Javascript and jQuery are also available.

## Session 3

D3 and Google map API will be introduced in this session. [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1paSzazJEQV3jkrPDvGyM6wKifaGgkZwWRotKwvwMNy0/edit?usp=sharing) is the slide for this session.

### 1. Chart Libraries

You'll be creating visualizations as part of Purdue Ironhacks, so knowledge of some javascript charting library would be handy.   
Here are some useful ones:
+ <a href="http://arborjs.org" target="_blank">Arbor.js</a> - A graph visualization library   
+ <a href="http://d3js.org" target="_blank">D3.js</a> - A library to create interactive graphics and visualizations. For a video tutorial series, you can refer [here](https://www.udemy.com/data-visualize-data-with-d3js-the-easy-way/learn/v4/overview). For credentials, you can login to blackironhack.com. [Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzsqix59bgXxiA2EFdBqja5ofDT8eJw-gaLiAtFt-Ozfmg-Q/viewform?c=0&w=1) for D3.
+ <a href="http://c3js.org" target="_blank">C3.js</a> - A library built on top of D3.js which allows you create charts with few lines of code. <a href="./Charts-with-c3js-tutorial.md" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a quick tutorial on c3.js    
+ <a href="http://sigmajs.org" target="_blank">Sigma.js</a> - Another graph visualization library   

### 2. Google Maps Javascript API

Purdue Ironhacks will involve playing with location data, so Google Maps is a recommended feature to have in your project. <a href="./session3/GoogleMap/Google-Maps-Tutorial.md" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a quick tutorial on Google Maps API.

## Other material 

### Datasets   

The rules require you to use one mandatory dataset [Climate Data Online](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web) and one dataset from either [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov) or [Open Indy Data Portal](http://data.indy.gov/). You can read more about these datasets [here](Datasets.md)

### Tutorial Project    

We have made a complete tutorial project using a different problem statement. You can find the tutorial [here](Tutorial Project.md) and demo [here](http://rawgit.com/goldironhack/2017-Purdue-Ironhack-Tutorials/master/2017-Purdue-Ironhacks-Tutorial-Project.html).
